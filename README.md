# Python - Data Science Essentials (Part 2)

## Date - 27th October, 2020 - 06th November, 2020

This repository contains my learning path of Python for Data Science (Part 2).

Here, I haven't included the files of Chapter 1 and 2, since there was no practical implementation works needed and was more of an introduction. However, I am listing out the chapters.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Data Science
- Defining data science
- Why use Python for data science?
- Where does AI fit in?

## Chapter 2 - Introduction to Machine Learning
- Machine learning 101
- Grouping Machine learing algorithms

## Chapter 3 - Regression Models
- Linear regression
- Multiple linear regression
- Logistic regression : Concepts
- Logistic regression : Data preparation
- Logistic regression : Treat missing values
- Logistic regression : Re-encode variables
- Logistic regression : Validating dataset
- Logistic regression : Model deployment
- Logistic regression : Model evaluation
- Logistic regression : Test prediction

## Chapter 4 - Clustering Models
- K-means method
- Hierarchical methods
- DBSCAN for outlier detection

## Chapter 5 - Dimension Reduction Methods
- Explanatory factor analysis
- Principal componenet analysis (PCA)

## Chapter 6 - Other Popular Machine Learning Methods
- Association rules models with Apriori
- Neural networks with a perceptron
- Instance-based learning with KNN
- Decision tree models with CART
- Bayesian models with Naive Bayes
- Ensemble models with random forests
